    "# Introduction\n",
    "With the rapid growth of emerging applications like social network, semantic web, sensor networks and LBS (Location Based Service) applications, a variety of data to be processed continues to witness a quick increase. Effective management and processing of large-scale data poses an interesting but critical challenge. Once you have Data collected at one layer, next step is to take it to proccessing layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this concept we will learn ways to proccess big data in a distributed environment with parallel computation. Tools used in industry at this layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Apache Spark:**  Spark is the open standard for flexible in-memory data processing that enables batch, real-time, and advanced analytics on the Apache Hadoop platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Apache Flink:** Apache Flink is an open source streaming platform which provides you tremendous capabilities to run real-time data processing pipelines in a fault-tolerant way at a scale of millions of events per second. It has better support for stream processing and some significant improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Apache Spark vs Apache Flink**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flink and Spark are both general-purpose data processing platforms and top level projects of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). While Spark is a batch oriented system that operates on chunks of data, called RDDs, Apache Flink is a stream processing system able to process row after row in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Apache Sqoop:** Apache Sqoop is a tool in Hadoop ecosystem which is designed to transfer data between HDFS (Hadoop storage) and relational database servers like mysql, Oracle RDB, SQLite, Teradata, Netezza, Postgres etc. Apache Sqoop imports data from relational databases to HDFS, and exports data from HDFS to relational databases. It efficiently transfers bulk data between Hadoop and external datastores such as enterprise data warehouses, relational databases, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Apache Sqoop?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as we know that Apache Flume is a data ingestion tool for unstructured sources, but organisations store their operational data in relational databases. So, there was a need of tool which can import and export data from relational databases. This is why Apache Sqoop was born. Sqoop can easily integrate with Hadoop and dump structured data from relational databases on HDFS, complimenting the power of Hadoop. This is why Apache Flume is an important part of Hadoop Ecosystem."

    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sense, if you want to compute a complex aggregation on spark, you need to distribute the task in the cluster.\n",

    "**Example 2:**\n",

    "\n",
    "We live in a computer era. Internet is part of our everyday lives and information is only a click away. Just open your favorite search engine, like Google, AltaVista, Yahoo, type in the key words, and the search engine will display the pages relevant for your search. But how does a search engine really work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The usefulness of a search engine depends on the relevance of the result set it gives back. There may of course be millions of web pages that include a particular word or phrase; however some of them will be more relevant, popular, or authoritative than others. A user does not have the ability or patience to scan through all pages that contain the given query words. One expects the relevant pages to be displayed within the top 20-30 pages returned by the search engine. Modern search engines employ methods of ranking the results to provide the \"best\" results first that are more elaborate than just plain text ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our aim is to **Rank the webpages to provide best search results.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we will use Page Rank Algorithm. The idea that Page Rank introduce is that, the importance of any web page can be judged by looking at the pages that link to it. Let's take an example to understand the algorithm better:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"images/pagerank.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 How the Algorithm Works?\n",
    "\n",
    "The PageRank algorithm outputs a probability distribution that represents the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on web links will arrive at a particular web page. If we run the PageRank program with the input data file and indicate 20 iterations we shall get the following output: \n",
    "\n",
    " ```\n",
    " url_4 has rank: 1.3705281840649928.\n",
    " url_2 has rank: 0.4613200524321036.\n",
    " url_3 has rank: 0.7323900229505396.\n",
    " url_1 has rank: 1.4357617405523626.\n",
    " ```\n",
    "The results clearly indicates that URL_1 has the highest page rank followed by URL_4 and then URL_3 & last URL_2. The algorithm works in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a URL (page) is referenced the most by other URLs then its rank increases, because being referenced means that it is important which is the case of URL_1.\n",
    "If an important URL like URL_1 references other URLs like URL_4 this will increase the destination’s ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3 Introduction to the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the entire concept, we will be using MEDLINE records (abstracts in the life sciences domain). \n",
    "The links represent content-similarity links, i.e., pairs of abstracts that are similar in the words they contain. For example, consider pmid (unique identifier in the MEDLINE collection) [8709207](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8709207). See the \"Related Links\" panel on the right hand side of the browser? The data provided above represent instances of graphs defined by such links.\n",
    "\n",
    "The files are tab-delimited adjacency list representations of the link between these medical records and hence their webpages. The first token on each line represents the unique id of the source node, and the rest of the tokens represent the target nodes (i.e., outlinks from the source node). If a node does not have any outlinks, its corresponding line will contain only one token (the source node id).\n",

    "## 5.1 Introduction: Zipf's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "Named after the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf (1902-1950), Zipf's Law describes an empirical law that describes the phenomenon in the physical and social sciences where many types of data can be approximated by Zipf distribution - a family of discrete power law probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linguistics, Zipf's law states that given some text of natural language, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.  The most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "**For example**,\n",
    "In one sample of words in the English language, the most frequently occurring word, **\"the\"**, accounts for nearly 7% of all the words (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word **\"of\"** accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by **\"and\"** (28,852). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Zipf's law then predicts that frequency of element of rank $k$ can be approximated by,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(k; s, N) = \\frac{1/k^s}{\\sum_{n=1}^N (1/n^s)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the number of elements, and $s$ is the value of the exponent characterizing the distribution.  Normally, $s$ is defined to be $1$.\n",

    "- In previously covered concepts we saw how to run spark application in a standalone mode. When it comes to processing Big Data, the Spark application must be written in a way to optimize the resources allocated to the cluster. The architecture understanding will help in visualizing the parallel processing that occurs inside a spark application.\n",

But the **limitation is that all machine learning algorithms cannot be effectively parallelized**. Each algorithm has its own challenges for parallelization, whether it is task parallelism or data parallelism.\n",

Think of it like this — thinking of how we learned things (i.e. how we learned colors, animal names), a similar learning process is done in machine learning. Someone taught us color names, identifying animal with names. Similarly, in machine learning, we have to provide accurate examples via historical data so that the **machine learning process learns from the historical data to train a classification model**.\n",

    "**1. StringIndexer:** StringIndexer encodes a string column of labels to a column of label indices. The indices are in [0, numLabels], ordered by label frequencies, so the most frequent label gets index 0. If the input column is numeric, we cast it to string and index the string values. you must set the input column of the component to this string-indexed column name. In many cases, you can set the input column with setInputCol. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. OneHotEncoder:** One-hot Encoding: One-hot encoding maps a column of label indices to a column of binary vectors, with at most a single one-value. This encoding allows algorithms which expect continuous features, such as Logistic Regression, to use categorical features. For example with 5 categories, an input value of 2.0 would map to an output vector of [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]. The last category is not included by default because it makes the vector entries sum up to one so an input value of 4.0 maps to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0].\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. VectorAssembler:** VectorAssembler is a transformer that combines a given list of columns into a single vector column. It is useful for combining raw features and features generated by different feature transformers into a single feature vector, in order to train ML models like logistic regression and decision trees.\n"
